# A4
## Deadline: March 5th, 23:59 PM (PST)

In A4, you are going to implement the Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. You will use the google-deepmind's MuJoCo environment, mediated by dm_control. You will implement the algorithms in the `td.py` and `dqn.py` files.

### Setup

Create a virtual environment and install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
cd <to the directory where A4/environment.yml is located>
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate A4
```

### Temporal Difference (TD) Learning

View the instructions in the `A4_part1_cartpole_td.ipynb`.

### Deep Q-Network (DQN)
